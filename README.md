This is my mobile-first website assignment given by Collaborative Enterprises. I made this website using Bootstrap 4, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 
User has to type in his name which on submitting leads him to the second page where he can choose any one of his go-to junk food and on the third page, the selected option as well as his entered name are displayed.
